I recommend creating a virtualenv before building

so something like this:
```
python3 -m venv pass_venv
source pass_venv/bin/activate
bash build_script.sh
```

# build_script_alternate.sh deletes everything except for the binary

# build_script.sh simply deletes the stuff which isn't required after build
