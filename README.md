I recommend creating a virtualenv before building

so something like this:
```
python3 -m venv pass_venv
source pass_venv/bin/activate
bash build_script.sh
```
if the build scripts dont work, it might be because you might need to use it through "python3 -m" instead

You must also have a C compiler installed

For example gcc

# build_script.sh simply deletes the stuff which isn't required after build
